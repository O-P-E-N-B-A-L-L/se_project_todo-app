# Project 4: The Simple To-Do App

This to-do app is the 4th (mini) project through [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/), a simple app for tracking various tasks and deadlines.

This app serves primarily as an intro to refactoring; Cleaning up old code, and organizing it in a smarter way using classes and modular files.
